# ClearingHouse

ClearingHouse is a protocol that allows for asset issuance and p2p trading on the [Viacoin](http://viacoin.org) blockchain.

Viacoin is a particularly fast digital currency which was designed to be the data-carrier for ClearingHouse, 25x faster than Bitcoin.

It was released on 11th August 2014 (although this website is under construction).

You can read more about it on the Viacoin Blog: http://blog.viacoin.org/2014/08/11/1-clearinghouse.html

## XCH

XCH is the native currency of ClearingHouse and is required to issue crypto assets and stocks.

XCH cannot be mined. For a period of ~45 days starting 11th august 2014 Viacoins can be used to initialize XCH.

## Clearwallet

[Clearwallet.co](https://clearwallet.co) is a web implementation that takes advantage of the ClearingHouse protocol.

your trades automatically.
